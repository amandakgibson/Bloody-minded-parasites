Simulation scripts for Gibson, Stoy, Lively 2018, Journal of Evolutionary Biology: Bloody-minded parasites and sex: the effects of fluctuating virulence

Three R files:
  - GibsonStoyLively2018_JEB_deterministic_Simulation: simulation without any temporal variation in virulence
  - GibsonStoyLively2018_JEB_PBAR_Simulation: simulation with temporal variation in virulence that has no or positive autocorrelation
  - GibsonStoyLively2018_JEB_NBAR_Simulation: simulation with temporal variation in virulence that has zero autocorrelation
